## 💡 Key Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Time-lock mechanism** - Core feature well implemented
2. **Anti-spam measures** - Creation fees + min stakes effective
3. **Proportional payouts** - Fair distribution model
4. **Test coverage** - Edge cases properly handled
5. **Documentation** - Easy to understand and use

### Potential Challenges
1. **Manual resolution** - Needs oracle for automation
2. **Single admin** - Centralization risk (needs multi-sig)
3. **Frontend gaps** - Mock data needs real implementation
4. **Mainnet readiness** - Requires audit first

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **Keep testing** - Project is solid
2. ⚠️ **Complete frontend** - High priority
3. ⚠️ **Security audit** - Before mainnet
4. ℹ️ **Oracle integration** - Future enhancement
5. ℹ️ **DAO governance** - Long-term goal

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Status
- ✅ Authorization checks implemented
- ✅ Time locks enforced
- ✅ Input validation present
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Integer overflow safe
- ⚠️ Events not emitted (added in improved version)
